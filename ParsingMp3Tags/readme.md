# ID3 Tags

The MP3 file format, didn't provide any means for including metadata about the song.

**ID3 tags** were invented to solve this problem.

* You can tell if an MP3 file includes **ID3 tags** by examining the *last 128 bytes* of the file.
* If they begin with the characters TAG, you have found a ID3 tag.

**Tags are fixed-width fields with no spacing between them.**

`Song`, `album`, `artist`, and `comment` are **30 bytes each**.
The `year` is four bytes and the `genre` just gets one, which is an index into a list of predefined genres.

The format of the tag is as follows:

    Field      | TAG | song | artist | album | year | comment | genre
    Byte Width | 3   | 30   | 30     | 30    | 4    | 30      | 1
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    128 Bytes

A minor change was later made to ID3 tags to allow them to include track numbers, creating ID3v1.1. In that format, if the 29th byte of a comment is null and the 30th is not, the 30th byte is an integer representing the track number.

## Lets write a parser!

Scenario 1:

    As a *user*
    When I run the program against an MP3 file
    Any tag present is identified

Scenario 2:

    As a *user*
    When an ID3 tag is detected
    Tag data is output to the screen

    Accept:
      When no tag found "No tag found" outputted

Scenario 3:

    As a *user*
    When an ID3 tag has a track number
    The track number is correctly outputted

## Test Data

The file `frederic-chopin-piano-sonata-2-op35-3-funeral-march.mp3` is included in this repository - sourced from the collection at [mfiles](http://www.mfiles.co.uk/mp3-files.htm)

If you open this file up in a hex editor (tip: you can rename the file to .bin and Visual Studio will happily open it) and the last 128 bytes of the file look like this

    TAGFuneral March (Sonata Op.35)Frederic Chopinwww.mfiles.co.ukÂ© Music Files Ltd

This is an ID3V1 tag, with no track information.
